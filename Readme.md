## Object Oriented Programming Principles

1. **Encapsulation**  
    It is concerned with bundling data and methods that operate on the data in a single unit.    
    It also hides the internal state of a class so that we can create robust applications.  
    ```java  
    public class Account {
        private int balance;
        public void deposit(int amount) {
            if(amount>0)
                balance+=amount;
        }
        public void withdraw(int amount) {
            if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount)
                balance -= amount;
        }
        public int getBalance() {
            return balance;
        }
    }
   ```
    *Without Encapsulation, we would have declared `balance` as public, 
    thus we would not have control over what values the balance can have(negative or positive)*
2. **Abstraction**  
    It states that we should reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.  
    We make everything else private or abstracted from user and only expose necessary interface or functions.
   ```java
    public class MailService {
       public void sendEmail() {
           connect();
           authenticate();
           disconnect();
       }
       private void connect() {
           System.out.println("Connected");
       }
       private void disconnect() {
           System.out.println("Disconnected");
       }
       private void authenticate() {
           System.out.println("Authenticated");
       }
    } 
   ```
   *We only expose `sendMail` method to the user and hide internally used functions like `connect`, `disconnect` etc.  
    This helps to simplify usage for the end user as any unnecessary methods are hidden from user*  
3. **Inheritance**  
    It is principle which states that we should implement common code in a parent class and inherit those in our child class.  
    This will reduce code duplication as well as development effort of re-writing same logic in every child class.
    ```java
    public class UIControl {
        public void enable() {
            System.out.println("Enabled");
        }
    }
    
    public class TextBox extends UIControl{
        public void acceptInput() {
            System.out.println("Accepting input");
        }
    }
    
    public class Paragraph extends UIControl{
        public void displayText() {
            System.out.println("Text displayed");
        }
    }
   
    public class InheritanceMain {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            TextBox textBox = new TextBox();
            textBox.enable();
            textBox.acceptInput();
            Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph();
            paragraph.enable();
            paragraph.displayText();
        }
    }
    ```
   *We would have implemented `enable` method in both `TextBox` as well as `Paragraph`, 
    but due to inheritance, we were able to skip redefining*
