## Object Oriented Programming Principles

1. **Encapsulation**  
    It is concerned with bundling data and methods that operate on the data in a single unit.    
    It also hides the internal state of a class so that we can create robust applications.  
    ```java  
    public class Account {
        private int balance;
        public void deposit(int amount) {
            if(amount>0)
                balance+=amount;
        }
        public void withdraw(int amount) {
            if (amount > 0 && balance >= amount)
                balance -= amount;
        }
        public int getBalance() {
            return balance;
        }
    }
   ```

*Without Encapsulation, we would have declared `balance` as public, 
    thus we would not have control over what values the balance can have(negative or positive)*
